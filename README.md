To You, Who I Lost in Childhood

To you who found me when I didn’t know I was lost,
To you who saw light in me before I knew it could shine,
To you who held my fears with small, soft hands,
To you who stood by me when the world felt too wide,

To you who taught me laughter when silence felt safer,
To you who believed in my dreams before I could name them,
To you who made every scraped knee feel like victory,
To you who danced with me in the rain and called it a parade,

To you who listened to my secrets like sacred truths,
To you who never mocked the wonder in my eyes,
To you who ran beside me even when I slowed down,
To you who gave me courage in your every yes,

To you who understood the storm behind my quiet,
To you who showed me love without needing words,
To you who made home out of nothing but presence,
To you who softened my anger just by being near,

To you who disappeared with the turning of time,
To you who became a memory wrapped in gold,
To you who still visits in dreams I don’t speak of,
To you who remains the echo behind every "what if,

To you who I loved before I knew what love meant,
To you who left a space no one else could fill,
To you who made my childhood beautiful just by being in it
To you, always you my first light, my quiet loss.
